      <h2>Particulate Matter Sensor</h2>
      <p>Particulate Matter (PM) refers to tiny, solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. These particles vary in size and composition, and they can have diverse sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and natural sources like dust and pollen. Monitoring particulate matter is crucial for assessing air quality and potential health risks, as fine particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory system.</p>

      <h2>Ozone Sensor</h2>
      <p>An ozone sensor is a specialized device that detects and measures the concentration of ozone (O3) in the air. Ozone is a reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms and is present in the Earth's atmosphere. While beneficial in the stratosphere, ground-level ozone can be harmful to human health and the environment. Ozone sensors are essential tools for monitoring air quality and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, especially in urban areas and industrial settings.</p>

        <h2>pH Sensor</h2>
        <p>A pH sensor is a device designed to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution by detecting the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating acidity, values above 7 indicating alkalinity, and a pH of 7 considered neutral. pH sensors play a crucial role in various fields, including environmental monitoring, water treatment, and scientific research, providing essential information for processes where maintaining a specific pH level is critical.</p>

          <div class="sensor-content">
            <h2>Turbidity Sensor</h2>
            <p>A turbidity sensor measures the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by the presence of suspended particles, such as sediment, silt, or organic matter. Turbidity is an important parameter in water quality assessment, as it affects the transparency of water and can impact ecosystems. Turbidity sensors find applications in environmental monitoring, water treatment plants, and research studies where the clarity of water is crucial. These sensors help in assessing the degree of water pollution and ensuring the effectiveness of water purification processes.

            <h2>COnductivity Sensor</h2>
            <p>A conductivity sensor, also known as an electrical conductivity sensor, measures the ability of a solution to conduct an electric current. It is particularly useful in assessing the concentration of dissolved ions, such as salts or minerals, in liquids. Conductivity sensors find applications in water quality monitoring, industrial processes, and environmental studies. By measuring the conductivity of a solution, these sensors provide insights into its chemical composition, helping to determine purity, salinity, or contamination levels.</p>
